# Deep_Learning_Keras_API_Project
When the bank hires a new potential customer, can you assess whether the customer can repay the loan?

Regarding that, you'll create a model that can predict whether a borrower will be able to repay the loan, taking into account historical data on loans issued, along with information on whether the borrower is in default (charge-off).

You currently have the data of a lending company. If you want to increase the success of your model, feature engineering is very effective for this. The prerequisite for feature engineering is to know the data well. In the exploratory data analysis process, try to learn the details of the data and plan your actions. Analyzng trends, patterns, and relatonshps in the Data. Examine the correlations of the features with the target variable.

Moreover detect missing values and deal with them. Also remove unnecessary or duplicate features. Convert categorical string properties to dummy variables.

At the end of this project; You will learn to develop a deep learning model with neural network architecture. Besides, you will learn hands-on about how you can evaluate the prediction success of the model you created.
